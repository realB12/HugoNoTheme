## Scope and Purpose of this theme
This Hugo-theme is **bare-bones minimalistic on purpose**! 

Minimalistic does not mean as minimalistic or stripped of as possible, but being reduced to whatever Hugo delivers out of the box (no 3rd-party components or dependencies) but will be required by MOST HugoThemes that might be based on this.

As this intended BareBones-Theme comes **without css or design-fluff** (e.g. bootstrap) and therefore comes in white and black ugliness, it is great for 

a) **learning the fundamental core theme components** and how HUGO builds upon them in general,  without being distacted and finally being lost in the overwhelming feature-fluff of the themes that normally are offered for download.   

b) having a **minimalistig testbed** for testing our own stuff without interfering with non-required complexity or 3rd-Party dependencies. BareBones is Hugo plus our HugoNoTheme-Theme! Period. 

c) The NoThemes-Theme is a great **starting point for your own**, more sophisticated themes.
